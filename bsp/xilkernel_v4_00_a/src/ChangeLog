Change Log for Xilkernel v4.00.a
=================================

2008-04-10

	* data/xilkernel_v2_1_0.mld: Change description to remove
	reference to OPB timer.
	
2008-02-20

	* src/src/sys/alloc.c: Make kernel stack size equal to the greater
	of 1024 bytes or pthread_stack_size. New stack start pointer
	variable used to switch stacks in kernel entry routines.
	* src/include/arch/<processor>/arch.h: Remove KERNEL_IRQ_STACKSZ
	* src/src/arch/<processor>/entry<sub_type>.S: Load new stack
	pointer from kernel_irq_stack_ptr rather than offset from label
	kernel_irq_stack.
	
2007-10-22

	* data/xilkernel_v2_1_0.mld: Change depends tag to standalone_v2_00_a.
	
2007-10-15

	* Makefile_mb.sh: Fix regression with compiler used in kernel Make. Always 
	use *-gcc

	* timer.h: Add prototype for xget_clock_ticks

2007-09-26  

	* ktypes.h: Add new field 'remain' for storing process timeout information
	
	* process.c: When unblocking a process waiting on a timeout, store the
	remaining timeout amount in the process data structure.

	* semaphore.c: Add sys/timer.h to includes

	* timer.c: Cleanup prototypes. Add new function to compute ticks_to_ms. 
	Store timeout remaining in process data structure. Update to remove_tmr 
	on 2007-09-11 was not sufficient. Since the previous scheme required an 
	interrupt to deallocate removed timers. It could cause an application to 
	run out of timers, before the next interrupt. Created new scheme, where
	active_tmr lists are updated promptly upon a timer being deactivated. 

	* xtrace.c/.h: New xtrace API for internal use. Minimally intrusive way
	to instrument kernel and log events of interest. Log gets printed out 
	later through debugger. Not available through MSS.
	
2007-09-19  
	
	* timer_intr_handler.c/<arch>-hw.c: Fix for bug where threads could starve 
	because of the way we always used to refresh PIT timer. Now, when a thread 
	receives only a partial tick, the timer is not refreshed and instead the 
	thread receives one more full time quantum. cr=448047
	
2007-09-11 

	* timer.c: Fix bug with timer handling of closely scheduled add/remove 
	of timers. The changes make sure that no ghost timers are left in the
	timer lists and there are no aliasing effects. cr=448047
